## Overview

## Gameplay

- **Objective:** *Your main objective is to get a total winning score point of 80 in 30 seconds. You can choose from any of the four backgrounds!*
- **Controls:** 
    - **Movement:** [Arrow Up key] to move up and [Arrow Down key] to move down. You will be restricted to vertical motion only.
    - **Actions:** [Space bar] to shoot lasers at enemies.
    - **General:** The maximum ammo given to you will be 50 which will recharge with time. Shoot enemies to gain points. Colliding with enemies will                       cause you to lose 2 points.
- **Details:**
    There are five types of enemies in the game (whew!). The standalone fishes have 5 lives. So you will require 5 ammos to destroy them. Similarly         your score will go up to 5. The huge fish has 20 lives, which when destroyed will earn you 20 points and will require 20 ammos. Upon destruction of     this fish, a flurry of smaller fish will approach you with different speeds. These have 3 lives and upon destruction will cost you 3 ammos and gain     you 3 points each.
    You will find a glowing fish. This will act as a power up. You can destroy this fish also with 15 ammos and gain 15 score points. However, if you       let it collide with the player, it will act as a powerup and shoot two lasers per ammo at the enemies. Mind you, colliding with the glowing fishes      will not cause you any loss of points.
